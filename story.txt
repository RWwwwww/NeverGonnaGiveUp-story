Jack is a sophomore and major in Computer Engineering. He is currently taking a ECE class, and he just finished his first midterm of this class last week. He really likes this class and the professor. 

Jack found his classes really hard and would often go to office hours to help understand the material better. 

The most recent time Jack went to office hours he got some inside intel about the midterm he had just taken.

Jack takes the midterm and fails.

After a long time, Jack is almost forgot this professor, but he heard that professor's favoirate song is 'Never Gonna Give Up'.
